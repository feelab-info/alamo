Dr. Anuradha Annaswamy received her Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Yale University in 1985. She has been a member of the faculty at Yale, Boston University, and MIT where currently she is the director of the Active-Adaptive Control Laboratory and a Senior Research Scientist in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Her research interests pertain to adaptive control theory and applications to aerospace, automotive, and propulsion systems, cyber- physical systems science, and CPS applications to Smart Grids, Smart Cities, and Smart Infrastructures. She is the author of a hundred journal publications and numerous conference publications, co-author of a graduate textbook on adaptive control (2004), and co-editor of several reports including “Systems & Control for the future of humanity, research agenda: Current and future roles, impact and grand challenges,” (Elsevier) “IEEE Vision for Smart Grid Control: 2030 and Beyond,” (IEEE Xplore) and Impact of Control Technology, (ieeecss.org/main/IoCT-report, ieeecss.org/general/IoCT2-report).

Vineet Nair received his MPhil in Energy Technologies from the University of Cambridge. He is currently a Ph.D. student in Computational Science and Engineering at MIT, where he is supervised by Dr. Annaswamy. Vineet has considerable research experience in applying distributed optimization, game theory, and control systems tools to model power grids and distributed energy resources (DERs).
